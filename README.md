# Project Description
<p>
This repository contains the code for the <b>Evolution Pool</b> which is a component of EVOLVE's Education and Finance DApp. This is where user's can choose to deposit a percentage of their earned $EVOLVE tokens into a community pool. Funds deposited into the community pool are put to work with AAVE's Lending and Borrowing Protocol so that users are able to collectively invest and earn a greater APY.
